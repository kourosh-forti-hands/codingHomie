## 🌟 **Overview**

The Elite Bedrock System uses **optimization profiles** to automatically configure your AI agents for different scenarios. Each profile represents a carefully balanced combination of:

- **Model Selection**: Which Bedrock models to use for each agent
- **Cost Controls**: Budget limits and spending optimization
- **Performance Tuning**: Token limits, timeouts, and response quality
- **Behavior Configuration**: Temperature, creativity, and precision settings
- **Role Specialization**: Task-specific configurations per agent type

{
  "optimization_profile": "custom",
  "model_preferences": {
    "custom_model_assignments": {
      # High-value agents get premium models
      "backend": "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0",
      "ml": "anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0",
      
      # Support agents get cost-effective models
      "frontend": "anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0",
      "qa": "anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0",
      "devops": "meta.llama3-8b-instruct-v1:0",
      "coordinator": "anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0"
    }
  },
  "budget_settings": {
    "daily_limit": 15.0,
    "alert_threshold_percentage": 70
  }
}
```

### **Advanced Customization Options**

#### **Per-Agent Temperature Override**
```python
{
  "agent_temperature_overrides": {
    "frontend": 0.9,  # High creativity for UI
    "backend": 0.2,   # Low creativity for reliability
    "qa": 0.1,        # Maximum precision for testing
    "ml": 0.4,        # Moderate for ML tasks
    "devops": 0.3,    # Low for infrastructure
    "coordinator": 0.6 # Moderate for management
  }
}
```

#### **Dynamic Model Selection Rules**
```python
{
  "dynamic_routing_rules": {
    "task_complexity": {
      "simple": ["claude-3-haiku", "titan-text-express"],
      "medium": ["claude-3-5-sonnet", "llama-3-8b"], 
      "complex": ["claude-3-opus", "llama-3-70b"]
    },
    "budget_based": {
      "high_budget": "use_premium_models",

      "normal": ["claude-3-5-sonnet"],
      "extended": ["claude-3-opus"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔄 **Dynamic Routing**

The system includes intelligent routing that adapts model selection based on:

### **Task Complexity Analysis**
```python
def analyze_task_complexity(task_description):
    complexity_indicators = {
        "simple": ["fix bug", "update text", "simple change"],
        "medium": ["implement feature", "create component", "add functionality"],
        "complex": ["design architecture", "optimize performance", "implement algorithm"],
        "creative": ["design UI", "create innovative", "brainstorm ideas"],
        "analytical": ["analyze data", "research", "statistical analysis"]
    }
    # Returns complexity level and recommended models
```

### **Budget-Aware Selection**
```python
def budget_aware_model_selection(remaining_budget, task_priority):
    if remaining_budget > 75%:
        return "primary_model"
    elif remaining_budget > 50%:
        return "balanced_model" 
    elif remaining_budget > 25%:
        return "economical_model"
    else:
        return "minimum_viable_model"
```

### **Performance-Based Fallbacks**
```python
def performance_fallback_logic(model_response_time, error_rate):
    if model_response_time > timeout_threshold:
        return "switch_to_faster_model"
    elif error_rate > acceptable_threshold:
        return "switch_to_more_reliable_model"
    else:
        return "continue_with_current_model"
```

## 🏆 **Best Practices**

### **Profile Selection Guidelines**

#### **Start Conservative**
1. Begin with **Cost Optimized** for learning
2. Graduate to **Balanced** for real projects
3. Upgrade to **Performance** when stakes are high
4. Use **Specialized profiles** for specific needs

#### **Monitor and Adjust**
```python
# Weekly profile effectiveness review
{
  "cost_efficiency": "actual_cost / expected_value",
  "quality_metrics": "output_quality / cost_per_output", 
  "user_satisfaction": "feedback_score / total_interactions",
  "time_efficiency": "tasks_completed / time_spent"
}
```

#### **Budget Management**
- Set **realistic daily budgets** based on project scope
- Use **80/20 rule**: 80% regular work, 20% experimentation
- Implement **escalation policies** for budget overruns
- Review **weekly spending patterns** for optimization

### **Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

❌ **Using Performance profile for learning** (wasteful)
❌ **Using Cost profile for production** (risky)
❌ **Not monitoring budget usage** (surprise bills)
❌ **Ignoring model performance metrics** (suboptimal results)
❌ **One-size-fits-all approach** (missing optimization opportunities)

### **Optimization Strategies**

#### **Workload-Based Optimization**
```python
# Morning: High creativity work
morning_profile = "creative"

# Afternoon: Implementation work  
afternoon_profile = "balanced"

# Evening: Testing and analysis
evening_profile = "analytical"
```

#### **Team-Based Configuration**
```python
# Different profiles for different team members
{
  "designers": "creative",
  "developers": "balanced", 
  "qa_engineers": "analytical",
  "architects": "performance",
  "managers": "cost_optimized"
}
```
