## üìã **Model Selection Checklist**

Before choosing models for your profile:

### **Requirements Analysis**
- [ ] What's your daily/monthly budget?
- [ ] What's your quality threshold?
- [ ] How important is response speed?
- [ ] What type of work (coding, creative, analysis)?
- [ ] Is this for production or development?

### **Technical Considerations**  
- [ ] Required context length for your tasks
- [ ] Integration complexity with existing systems
- [ ] Fallback strategy if primary model fails
- [ ] Regional availability in your AWS region
- [ ] Cost monitoring and alerting setup

### **Testing Strategy**
- [ ] Start with balanced profile
- [ ] Test different models with real tasks
- [ ] Measure quality vs cost trade-offs
- [ ] Monitor usage patterns for optimization
- [ ] Adjust profile based on results

## üèÜ **Best Practices**

### **Model Selection Strategy**
1. **Start conservative** with balanced profiles
2. **Measure actual usage** vs expectations
3. **Optimize based on data**, not assumptions
4. **Use right model for right task**
5. **Monitor costs continuously**

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- Using expensive models for simple tasks
- Choosing models based on marketing, not testing
- Ignoring context length limitations
- Not setting up proper budget controls
- Failing to test fallback strategies
